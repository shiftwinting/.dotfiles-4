# A fun Fennel based NeoVim config

Hello! This is my experiment in not-doing-anything-productive by having fun with Fennel, learning Lisp and configuring NeoVim. My config is centered around **LSP**, using [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig), **TreeSitter**, using [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) and [**Telescope**](https://github.com/nvim-telescope). Everything else is just handy dandy stuff that adds to the editing experience.

# Fennel and NeoVim

This config is based upon:

- [Magic Kit](https://github.com/Olical/magic-kit)

Magic Kit uses: [Aniseed](https://github.com/Olical/aniseed) to enable loading Fennel. 
Furthermore I've based and learned a lot from the following projects:

- [zest](https://github.com/tsbohc/zest.nvim)
- [datwaft dotfiles](https://github.com/datwaft/nvim/tree/master/fnl/core)
- 
Worth checking out if you want to enhance your config.
